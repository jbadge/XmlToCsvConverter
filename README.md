# XML to CSV Converter

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
This is a simple tool to convert XML data to CSV, grabbing the user defined fields they wish to grab from the XML. Used to parse Apple Health Data, but should work for any other XML files. User must know which fields they wish to grab from the XML file.

## Built With

**Tech used:** React, TypeScript

## Optimizations

This code is based on code used in another project and was zoomed out to take in any fields from the user, instead of specific fields. This allows for this to be of greater use to anyone who wants to use it.

## Lessons Learned:

This was built using AI. It is meant to be a quick tool to help in other projects, but I did learn that often, AI continues on a problem in an incorrect direction when taking a moment to log out parts of the code to see what is happening often more quickly pinpoints and resolves the issues than continuing the path with AI.
